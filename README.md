# next-template

âœ¨ A personal/opinionated bleeding edge Next.js template that I use for my projects, based around the T3 Stack.

It's based around or directly uses the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) with modifications and additions to suit my needs, it includes:

- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) as database ORM.
- A Docker Compose setup for local development with a Postgres database.
- [Biome.js](https://biomejs.dev/) to replace ESLint and Prettier.
- `next-auth@5.0.0-beta` for authentication.
